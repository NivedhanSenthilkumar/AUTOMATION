TASK :
Create a detailed digital marketing strategy for both, how will you execute it. Can see references to other similar B2B and Ecommerce Bakeries. The more rigorous, mathematical and broad it is, the better. Should not be superficial.
The task has to be done separately for two companies : Rollingpinn and Shopster
The deadline for the task is Friday 10AM.'''
